## Rules

If this is your first time playing Catan, we highly suggest you to read the [base rules](https://www.catan.com/sites/default/files/2021-06/catan_base_rules_2020_200707.pdf) before.

## Leaderboard

You can keep up with the progress of the game through the leaderboard on the top right of the screen.

A **yellow** arrow points to the current player,
a **red** arrow points to the player currently discarding half of their cards,
and a **green** arrow points to the player currently assessing a trade proposal.

Here is what each column in the leaderboard represents, in order:

1. the number of resource cards; gets red whenever the player is vulnerable to losing half of their cards
2. the number of development cards
3. the number of used knight cards; gets red whenever the player possesses the Largest Army special card
4. the length of the longest road; gets red whenever the player possesses the Longest Road special card
5. the total number of victory point (taking victory point cards into account)

## Buttons

You will need your mouse to perform most actions.
This section lists all the buttons and what each of them does.

### Build Road

## Events

### Rolling a 7

When a player rolls a seven, the game first checks whether there are any players with more than 7 resource cards.

If that is the case, then each player with more than 7 resource cards is prompted to discard half of their resource cards, like in the image below.

You may add/remove cards from the set of cards to be discarded by clicking on them.

When you have selected half of the cards, you may click on the OK button that will appear on the screen.

After all the players with more than 7 resource cards have discarded half of their cards, the game prompts the player that rolled the 7 to move the robber.

### Moving the robber

When a player rolls a 7 or uses a knight card, they must move the robber to another hex tile, which can be done by clicking in any of the highlighted tiles.

If you move the robber to a tile that contains more than one opponent, then you will have to choose which player you are going to rob by clicking on their building.
