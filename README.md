If you have [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/) on your machine, you can install the Lua modules with the following command.

luarocks install serpent 0.30-2
luarocks install ldoc 1.5.0-1
luarocks install argparse 0.7.1-1
luarocks install luacov 0.15.0-1
luarocks install luacov-html 1.0.0-1
```

## Tests

The tests reside in the `test/` folder, and can be run with the following command.

```
make test
```

If you want to check the test coverage, you may want to run the following command.

```
make test-coverage
```

This will generate a stats report. You may want an HTML page, so you can more easily inspect the coverage report. Simply run this command.

```
make html-coverage-report
```

You can also remove any output from the test coverage suite by running...

```
make clean
```

## Documentation

### Hosted

You can see the latest version of the documentation [here](https://guidanoli.github.io/catan-lua/).

### Local

You can also build the documentation locally by running the following command.

```sh
make docs
```

This should load the configurations from the `config.ld` file. You can tinker with the configuration however you like.
